# Preface {-}

<img src="images/tag3.svg" width="80%" />

I hope this document will serve as an organized collection for notes on the hardware specifications, operation, programming, errors, and data outputs of Wildlife Computers tags used at DUML.

These notes have been compiled from personal experience and experimentation, as well as through conversations with other users and technical support staff at Wildlife Computers. To the best of my ability everything included here is as accurate as possible and I've tried to indicate clearly where there are areas of uncertainty. That said, the tags can and do change including in the hardware, firmware, and software and so this information may become out of date without notice. My goal is to provide some memory of what we have figured out.

In the course of dealing with these tags, I've ended up writing a lot of code, including a couple of shiny apps, a couple of R packages, and various other odds and ends mostly in R. Where helpful, I'll include or link to code that I think is decent enough to share. Most of the code I've written is hosted on [my github](https://github.com/williamcioffi). 

Let me know if you are interested in contributing!

Finally, thanks to all the folks who provided information on these instruments or engaged in helpful discussions about how they might possibly be working. Including (but not limited to):
